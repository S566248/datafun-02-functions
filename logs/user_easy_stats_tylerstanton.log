2023-05-19 19:47:06,311 Correlation requires Python version 3.10 or greater.
2023-05-19 19:47:06,313 Your version is 3.11
2023-05-19 19:47:06,313 Here's some data with two lists:
2023-05-19 19:47:06,313 temp_in_F:[54, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 67, 72, 73, 74, 77]
2023-05-19 19:47:06,314 ince_cream_sales:[19, 21, 33, 32, 41, 42, 41, 41.5, 52, 45, 55, 61]
2023-05-19 19:47:06,314 correlation between temp_in_F and temp_in_F = 1.00
2023-05-19 19:47:06,314 correlation between temp_in_F and ice_cream_sales = 0.96
2023-05-19 19:47:06,315 Here are the central tendancy values of the X list:
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 mean of X value = 65.50
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 median of X value = 64.50
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 mode of X value = 54.00
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 Here are the central tendancy values of the Y list:
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 mean of Y value = 40.29
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 median of Y value = 41.25
2023-05-19 19:47:06,316 mode of Y value = 41.00
2023-05-19 19:47:06,318 Here are the measures of spread values of the Y list:
2023-05-19 19:47:06,318 var of X values = 52.81818181818182
2023-05-19 19:47:06,318 stdev of X values = 7.267611837335688
2023-05-19 19:47:06,318 lowest of X values= 54
2023-05-19 19:47:06,318 highest of X values = 77
2023-05-19 19:47:06,319 Here are the measures of spread values of the Y list:
2023-05-19 19:47:06,319 var of Y values = 159.74810606060606
2023-05-19 19:47:06,319 stdev of Y values = 12.63914973645799
2023-05-19 19:47:06,319 lowest of Y values= 19
2023-05-19 19:47:06,319 highest of Y values = 61
2023-05-19 19:47:06,320 Here's some bivariant data (2 variables, together):
2023-05-19 19:47:06,320 x:[54, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 67, 72, 73, 74, 77]
2023-05-19 19:47:06,320 y:[19, 21, 33, 32, 41, 42, 41, 41.5, 52, 45, 55, 61]
2023-05-19 19:47:06,320 Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
2023-05-19 19:47:06,320    slope = 1.66
2023-05-19 19:47:06,320    intercept = -68.53
2023-05-19 19:47:06,321 Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.
2023-05-19 19:47:06,321    At future x = 85,
2023-05-19 19:47:06,321    we predict the value of y will be 73.
2023-05-19 19:47:06,321 How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
2023-05-19 19:47:06,321 Remember to close the app. Control c (or d or z maybe) to close it.
